From docs/refactoring/.

## Quick Wins

- [ ] 01-clippy-lint-fixes: Mechanical Clippy warning fixes
- [ ] 05-module-visibility: Clean up public API surface

## Complexity Reductions

- [ ] 02-bomb-complexity: Decompose `compute_bomb_shell()`
- [ ] 03-heat-complexity: Reduce complexity in heat simulation
- [ ] 04-blast-complexity: Decompose `blast()` function

## Deferred (High Risk)

- [ ] 06-world-save-srp: Extract persistence concerns from WorldSave
