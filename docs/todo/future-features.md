# Future Features

From implementation plan phases 6-8.

## Phase 6: Procedural Generation

- [ ] Biomes with different material distributions
- [ ] Cave systems and underground features
- [ ] Surface features (trees, rocks, structures)
- [ ] WFC tile resolution (64x64 candidates)
- [ ] Stamp overlap with priority system

## Phase 7: Material Interactions

- [ ] Heat system and heat propagation
- [ ] Material reactions (corrosion, ignition, transformation)
- [ ] Decay and erosion
- [ ] Moisture layer (full resolution)
- [ ] Pressure layer (4x downsampled)

## Phase 8: Particles

- [ ] Particle emission from materials
- [ ] Particle deposition back to pixels
- [ ] Visual effects (sparks, smoke, debris)
- [ ] Bevy Mesh2d instance buffer or sprite batching
